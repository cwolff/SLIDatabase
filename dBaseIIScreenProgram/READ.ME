
Dear dBASE II User,

    At Ashton-Tate, we applaud your dBASE II endeavors and hope you enjoy
using our product to solve your information management needs.  It is with
pleasure that we provide you with dBASE II Screen Editor, a new Ashton -
Tate utility designed specifically for 16-bit operating system.

    As a utility, dBASE II Screen Editor will help you take advantage of
dBASE II's powerful features and provide you with an easy way to customize
your information on screen and in reports. With dBASE II Screen Editor you
can quickly edit files and generate a file of @SAY's for use with dBASE II's
Set Format command. Not only is this easy, it is more powerful than using
Modify Command!

    dBASE II Screen Editor is very simply to install.  If you have a mono-
chrome display, dBASE II Screen Editor is already installed for you.  All
you need to do is type "SED" and press your computer's Enter Key.

    If you have a color/graphics display, please follow these easy steps
to install dBASE II Screen Editor.

	1.  Type "SINSTALL SED.EXE" and press return.

	2.  "Do you want to change default parameters?" will come up on
	    your screen.  Answer "Y" to this question, and press your
	    computer's enter key to answer the next 10 questions.

	3.  When the question "Is it a Monochrome or Color adapter?" appears,
	    type "C", then press your enter key to answer the next 3 questions.

	4.  When the questions "Do you wish to save your data" appears, type
	    "Y".  Having completed this cycle, you can now run the program by
	    typing "SED" and pressing your Enter Key.

     Making back up copies of your disk is an important first step when using
computer software.  Please consult your dBASE II  Screen  Editor printed
documentation to copy this disk.  Once your new program is installed, you will
be able to use the on-line tutorial and manual for assistance.	This feature
is similar to the HELP command in dBASE II.

    At Ashton-Tate, we look forward to assisting you with your dBASE II projects
and hope dBASE II Screen Editor will be an efficient edition to your software
library.

					       Sincerely,


					       George Tate
					       Chairman, Ashton-Tate
